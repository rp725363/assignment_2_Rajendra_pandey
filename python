1.What are the two values of the Boolean data type? How do you write them?

Ans:- 
There are two type of boolean values , 1st True and 2nd is False. We write the in letter with capitalized first letter.

2. What are the three different types of Boolean operators?
Ans:-
There are three type of boolean oprators as below.
1. AND('a'&'b')
2. OR ('a'|'b')
3. NOT('a'!'b')


3. Make a list of each Boolean operator's truth tables (i.e. every possible combination of Boolean values for the operator and what it evaluate ).
Somebody help me , i am not good with this.

4. What are the values of the following expressions?
(5 > 4) and (3 == 5)
not (5 > 4)
(5 > 4) or (3 == 5)
not ((5 > 4) or (3 == 5))
(True and True) and (True == False)
(not False) or (not True)

Ans:-  True

5. What are the six comparison operators?
Ans:- 
Here are six comparison oprators as below:
1.Less than (<)
2.Greater than (>)
3.Less than or equal to (<=)
4.Greater than or equal to (>=)
5.Equal to (==)
6.Not equal to (!=)

6. How do you tell the difference between the equal to and assignment operators?Describe a condition and when you would use one.
Ans:-
Equls to:- we use equels to oprator (==) to compare vlaue if that is matched or not , usually used in conditional statement like if/else .
Assignment oprator :- Assignment oprator (=) used to assign a variable to a value.

Here in below example in first line we used assignment to to assign a value to variable(password), while in condition term (if/else) we use equels to compare given password to 
assigned password.
password='seceret'
user_input=input("Enter your password")

if user_input==password:
    print("access granted")
    
else:
    print("wrong password")
    
    

7. Identify the three blocks in this code:
spam = 0
if spam == 10:
print('eggs')
if spam > 5:
print('bacon')
else:
print('ham')
print('spam')
print('spam')

Ans :- Here are four blocks .
1st. - Used to aplly If statement to check spam value for 10.
2nd- used to apply to check the spam value is more that 5.
3rd - used to apply to else statement to and print inside it.
4th - used to print statement after else statement.

8. Write code that prints Hello if 1 is stored in spam, prints Howdy if 2 is stored in spam, and prints Greetings! if anything else is stored in spam.
Ans:- Code has been written as below.
spam=int(input(""))
if spam==1:
    print("Hello")
elif spam==2:
    print("howdy")
else:
    print("Greetings")
    
    I given access to user to enter number and given condition to code to decide print as above with if/elif/else.
    
    9.If your programme is stuck in an endless loop, what keys youâ€™ll press?
    Ans:-
    On window , linus & mac machine we can press (ctrl + c) 
    Pressing this combination sends a interrupr signal to the program, which will stop the loop excution.
    
 10. How can you tell the difference between break and continue?
 Ans:-
 We use break and countinue to control the flow of loop.
 as:- for i in range(10):
          if i==5:
          break
          print(i)
   Here in above example , loop will exit when values of i is 5 when facing itration,and program countinue excution after the loop.
   
   i.e:-
          for i in range(10):
          if i % 2 == 0:
          countinue
          print(i)
  
      while in this loop excution coutinue to excute while i have a even value , loop skip the itrate and coutier the excution of program.
      
      11. In a for loop, what is the difference between range(10), range(0, 10), and range(0, 10, 1)?
      Ans:-
     in given all three examples code will produce same output but first two (range(10) and range(0,10)) are using default argument while third (range(0,10,1))
     providing all arguments explicitly.
     
     12. Write a short program that prints the numbers 1 to 10 using a for loop. Then write an equivalent program that prints the numbers 1 to 10 using a while loop.
     Ans:- using for loop-
     for i in range(1,11):
    print(i)
     
     using while loop-
     i=1
while i <= 10:
    print(i)
    i+=1
    
    13. If you had a function named bacon() inside a module named spam, how would you call it after importing spam?
          
Ans-
we can call the span by importing as below:-

    import spam
    spam.bacon()
    import will call entire module then by using dot notion you can call specific function.
